Steps for implementation:

1.  [DONE] Deploy a VPC and a subnet
2.  Deploy an internet gateway and associate it with the VPC
3.  Setup a route table with a route to the IGW and associate it with the subnet
4.  Deploy an EC2 instance inside of the created subnet and associate a public IP
5.  Associate a security group that allows public ingress
6.  Change the EC2 instance to use a publicly available NGINX AMI
7.  Destroy everything
